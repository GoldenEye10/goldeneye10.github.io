### 5. Used soruce address
 I used the ‘source address’ to find the email. Lets open it to see if it contains any attachment.

---
 
![Desktop View](../assets/img/favicon/writeup/letsdefend/soc282/7.png){: width="972" height="589" }
 Yes, it does contain an attachment named ‘free-coffee.zip’ and the password is ‘infected’

---

![Desktop View](../assets/img/favicon/writeup/letsdefend/soc282/8.png){: width="972" height="589" }
 Now we got to analyze the attachment by uploading it on any of the above mentioned free services to check if its malicious or not. So first download the attachment in your VM

---

![Desktop View](../assets/img/favicon/writeup/letsdefend/soc282/9.png){: width="972" height="589" }
I uploaded the attachment file on the Virustotal and 61 out of 75 security vendors flagged it as malicious (Backdoor).

---

![Desktop View](../assets/img/favicon/writeup/letsdefend/soc282/10.png){: width="972" height="589" }
To check if the mail was delivered to the user or not by opening the ‘Monitoring->Investigation Channel’ and looking at the ‘device action’ part.

---

![Desktop View](../assets/img/favicon/writeup/letsdefend/soc282/11.png){: width="972" height="589" }
It says ‘allowed’ that means positive, it was delivered to the user.

---

![Desktop View](../assets/img/favicon/writeup/letsdefend/soc282/12.png){: width="972" height="589" }
 As per the playbook we have to delete the email from the user’s inbox by going to ‘Email Security’ tab and clicking the ‘Delete’ button.

---

![Desktop View](../assets/img/favicon/writeup/letsdefend/soc282/13.png){: width="972" height="589" }
Next step is to check if someone opened that attachment or not?

---
  
![Desktop View](../assets/img/favicon/writeup/letsdefend/soc282/14.png){: width="972" height="589" }
 So, I went to ‘Endpoint Security’ and search for ‘Felix’ the user who received the email. I checked the processes and found out ‘Coffee.exe’ process and it was the same executable that was inside the attachment.

---

![Desktop View](../assets/img/favicon/writeup/letsdefend/soc282/15.png){: width="972" height="589" }
Since, the user executed the malicious file that means the system has been infected and now the very first step is to isolate/contain the user so that it doesn’t spread to other users/systems.

---

![Desktop View](../assets/img/favicon/writeup/letsdefend/soc282/16.png){: width="972" height="589" }

 From the same ‘Endpoint Security’ page from where I checked its process, now I have contained the user.
