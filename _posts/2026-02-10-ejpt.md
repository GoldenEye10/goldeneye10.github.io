# My eJPT Exam Experience: Hands-On Pentesting Made Real

The **eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** is an entry-level, practical penetration testing certification. Unlike traditional exams, it’s entirely hands-on—you interact with a network of machines, perform enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation, and answer questions based on your findings.

I recently took the exam and completed it in under 6 hours, scoring 33 out of 35. My preparation involved a combination of the **INE eJPT course**, as well as solving **CTF challenges and TryHackMe labs**. This mix of structured learning and practical exercises was key to my success.

## What I Liked About the Exam

- **Flexible 48-Hour Window:** The exam gives you 48 hours to complete, which is more than enough if you’ve prepared. It allows you to take breaks and approach the exam methodically, which is helpful if you have other commitments or are new to pentesting.  
- **Practical, Hands-On Focus:** Enumeration, scanning, and exploitation form the core of the exam. It’s clear that the emphasis is on real-world pentesting methodology rather than memorizing theory.  
- **Comprehensive Learning Resources:** The **INE eJPT course** provided detailed lessons, exercises, and labs that cover every topic you’ll encounter in the exam. Paired with **CTF and TryHackMe labs**, I was able to practice in diverse environments and develop confidence in different attack techniques.  

## Things That Could Be Improved

- **In-Browser Kali Machine:** The exam uses an in-browser Kali VM. While convenient, I’m more efficient in my own customized VM. An option to connect via OpenVPN to a personal setup could make the experience smoother for those accustomed to their own environments.  

## How I Prepared

1. **INE eJPT Course:** I followed the structured course, which covered network scanning, enumeration, exploitation basics, and privilege escalation. The labs were excellent for practicing in an exam-like environment.  
2. **CTF Challenges:** I solved a variety of CTF challenges to apply the concepts learned in the course in realistic, problem-solving scenarios.  
3. **TryHackMe Labs:** I completed both beginner and intermediate labs, which provided hands-on practice with Linux, Windows, network enumeration, and exploitation tools.  

This combination of **structured learning (INE course) and hands-on practice (CTFs + TryHackMe)** made me confident and efficient during the exam.  

## Final Thoughts

The eJPT is an **ideal first step into penetration testing**. It’s practical, accessible, and tests real-world skills. If you combine the **INE eJPT course** with **CTF challenges and TryHackMe labs**, you’ll be well-prepared to pass the exam and build a strong foundation for advanced certifications like OSCP or eCPPT.  

**Tip:** Focus on enumeration and practice as much as possible—it’s the key to success in this exam.
