# CompTIA Security+ Review

I recently passed the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) exam, and I wanted to share my review of the experience for anyone considering this certification.

# Study Approach

My main preparation resource was Jason Dion’s Security+ training on Udemy. His course provided a solid foundation and covered all the exam objectives in a clear, structured way. I supplemented the lectures with practice exams, which helped me identify weak areas and get comfortable with the exam style questions.

# Exam Experience

The exam itself was challenging but fair. It included both multiple-choice questions and performance-based questions (PBQs). The PBQs required hands-on thinking, like analyzing logs, configuring security settings, and interpreting scenarios. Time management was crucial — I flagged a few tougher questions and came back to them after completing the easier ones.

The multiple-choice section tested not just definitions but real-world applications of concepts like access control, encryption, secure protocols, and incident response. Having done lots of practice tests really helped me feel confident during the exam.

# Key Takeaways

Know the concepts, not just the memorization: The exam focuses heavily on applying knowledge in practical scenarios.

Performance-based questions matter: Be prepared to analyze and problem-solve, not just recall facts.

Practice exams are essential: They trained me to think like the test and manage my time effectively.

# Final Thoughts

Overall, the Security+ was a valuable certification to earn. It gave me a strong baseline in cybersecurity concepts and validated my knowledge in areas like networking, cryptography, risk management, and security operations. For anyone looking to break into cybersecurity or strengthen their IT career, I’d definitely recommend it.

Verdict: The exam was tough but fair, and the preparation with Jason Dion’s course made a big difference. If you’re dedicated and put in the practice, you’ll be well prepared to succeed.
