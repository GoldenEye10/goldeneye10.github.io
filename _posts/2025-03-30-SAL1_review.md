## Overview
The **TryHackMe Security Analyst Level 1 (SAL1)** exam is a brand-new hands-on certification designed to test practical cybersecurity skills. In February 2025, TryHackMe announced its launch and offered free exam vouchers to those holding **CompTIA CySA+** or **Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)**. Naturally, I took advantage of this opportunity, Since I already held the BTL1 Certification.

## Should You Take SAL1?
### You should take SAL1 if:
- You want a **hands-on experience** like **CompTIA CySA+** or **BTL1**.
- You enjoy **learning through practical experience** rather than theoritical.
- You appreciate **affordable certifications**.

### You should NOT take SAL1 if:
- You’re **only looking to boost your resume**.
- You want a certification **just to pass HR filters**.

TryHackMe is a well-respected platform, but this certification is **brand new** and may take time to gain industry recognition.

## Preparation Strategy
TryHackMe recommends its **Cyber Security 101** and **SOC Level 1** pathways for exam preparation. Due to the limited time available before my free voucher expired (March 30, 2025), I just went with my knowledge from **BTL1**.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Master Splunk:** It plays a crucial role in the exam.
- **Prioritize hands-on exercises:** Especially SOC Simulators.
- **Time management is critical.**
- **Proper ducomentation is critical.**

---

## Exam Breakdown
The **SAL1 exam** consists of three sections, with a maximum score of **1000 points**:

- **200 points** – 80 **multiple-choice questions** (**1 hour**).
- **400 points** – **Scenario I** (hands-on investigation, **2 hours**).
- **400 points** – **Scenario II** (hands-on investigation, **2 hours**).

### Tools Provided:
- **Alerts Dashboard**
- **Splunk** (primary tool for analysis)
- **Analyst VM** (not heavily utilized, mostly for copying IPs into ‘TryDetectThis’, a TryHackMe fake VirusTotal)

### Exam Tips:
- **Close all True Positive alerts before the timer expires** – incomplete scenarios earn **zero** points.
- **Exam instructions are vague** about whether True Positives should be escalated. Over-escalation may cost points.
- **Multiple-choice questions are straightforward** – if you’ve taken **CompTIA Security+, ISC2 SSCP, or EC-Council CND**, you’ll do fine.

## Reporting Format
During preparation, I copied a **Documentation demo of exam on how to write report** to streamline my reports:

```
Alert description: <Type of attack>

### 5Ws
- **Who:** <Usernames, IPs, hostnames, etc.>
- **What:** <Type of attack>
- **Impact:** <What happened? Data exfiltration? Malware infection?>
- **When:** <Timestamps from Splunk>
- **Where:** <Device logs in Splunk>
- **Why:** <Attacker’s goal>

### Attacker Intent
- **Objective:** (e.g., ransomware, lateral movement, data theft)
- **Impact:** Was the attack successful?
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** (Identify relevant TTPs)

### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- **List all related IPs, hostnames, usernames, and artifacts.**

### Recommended Actions
- **Block IPs, disable compromised accounts, or take other necessary security measures.**

### Escalation Decision
- **State whether you are escalating the alert, if yes, then justify the reason.**
```

### AI Grading Criteria:
1. **Correctly identifying alerts** (True Positive vs. False Positive).
2. **Providing detailed 5W analysis.**
3. **Assessing attacker intent accurately.**
4. **Listing comprehensive IOCs.**
5. **Making correct escalation decisions.**

AI **strictly penalizes incorrect escalation choices** but seems to be lenient on typos and grammer.

## Exam Experience & Verdict
One frustration was the **inability to take defensive actions** when detecting attacks in Splunk. While I could **observe** the attack unfolding, I couldn’t **isolate systems or disable compromised accounts**, which felt limiting but makes sense you are just the level 1 SOC. The lab is kind of slow and you do not have to use lot of tool except for splunk.

### Exam Format Flaws:
- **No scenario details until after the timer starts.**
- **VM boot-up time counts against your timer.**
- **Does not allow you to confirm, so you can review all the alerts one final time before the end of each section**
- **Tip:** Immediately start VMs before reading the scenario.

### Final Thoughts:
- **Well-structured exam but seems very basic compared to BTL1.**
- **Great for SOC aspirants looking for hands-on experience. While BTL1 is focused more on incident response, this is pure SOC Scenario**

## Conclusion
Despite its pros and cons, **SAL1 is a solid fun hands-on blue team certification**. Beginners who complete **the relevant TryHackMe pathways** have a strong chance of passing. Upon success, you receive a **certification, Credly badge, and some well-earned bragging rights.**
